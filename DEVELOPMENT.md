# Development Guide

Welcome to the Belote development guide. This project is structured as a standard Python package.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd belote
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install in editable mode:**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Running the Game

After installing, you can run the game using the `belote` command for Classic mode:
```bash
belote
```

Or the `belatro` command for the Roguelite expansion:
```bash
belatro
```

Or via python:
```bash
python -m belote.main
python -m belote.belatro.main
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m belote.main
```

## Testing

We use `pytest` for testing. Install it if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install pytest
```

Run tests:
```bash
# Run all tests (Classic + BelAtro)
PYTHONPATH=src pytest

# Run only Classic Belote tests
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/

# Run only BelAtro tests
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/belatro/

# Run a single test file
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/test_game.py
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/belatro/test_scoring.py

# Run a single test by name
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/test_game.py::test_play_card_legal
PYTHONPATH=src pytest -k "test_scoring"

# Run with verbose output
PYTHONPATH=src pytest -v

# Run with coverage report
PYTHONPATH=src pytest --cov=belote --cov-report=term-missing
```

## Code Quality

The project maintains zero lint and type-check violations. Run all checks with:

```bash
# Type checking (0 errors expected, strict mode)
PYTHONPATH=src mypy --strict src/

# Linting (0 violations expected)
ruff check src/ tests/

# Full test suite (1007 tests expected)
PYTHONPATH=src pytest
```

Run all gates before committing:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m pytest --tb=short -q && \
  python -m mypy --strict src/ && \
  python -m ruff check src/ tests/
```

## Benchmarking

A benchmarking script is provided to measure rendering and AI performance:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/benchmark.py
```

3.0.0 baseline numbers (Linux, Python 3.10+, 1000 iterations):
- Render: 0.27 ms (±0.04)
- AI Hard decide_card: 0.026 ms (±0.003)
- BelAtro state update: 0.032 ms (±0.004)
- score_round: 0.169 ms
- legal_cards: 0.012 ms

Use these as a regression-detection floor for future changes.

## Accessibility

Set `BELOTE_A11Y=1` to emit one-line plain-text descriptions of card plays,
trick winners, locked contracts (4.6.5), declarations (4.6.5), and round
results to stderr — readable by terminal screen readers (Orca, NVDA over
WSL, VoiceOver via iTerm2).

The env var is read once at import; tests that mutate it must call
`belote.a11y._refresh_enabled_from_env()` after the patch. Hook points live
in `gameflow.py` (card plays, trick winners, contract announce at bid→play
transition, round result) and `belatro/main.py` (boss reveal, ante advance,
run won/lost).

## Optional Runtime Flags

The following environment variables enable opt-in features. Each is read
once at startup; toggling mid-run has no effect.

- `BELOTE_REPLAY=1` — after every Classic round, print a one-line summary
  of how often South's plays matched the Hard-AI's preferred line
  (e.g. `Replay: Optimal plays: 6/8 (75%)`). Educational only — never
  affects scoring. Backed by `src/belote/replay.py`.
- `BELOTE_GHOST=1` — silently record every BelAtro run (seed, deck,
  bids, plays, round outcomes) to
  `~/.local/share/belote/ghosts/<label>-<seed>.json`. The file is written
  once when the run ends. Useful for sharing or replaying interesting
  runs. Backed by `src/belote/belatro/ghost_run.py`.
- `NO_COLOR=<any-non-empty>` — suppress truecolor SGR escapes from
  `fg()` / `bg()` per the [no-color.org](https://no-color.org/) spec.
  Bold/dim/underline/reverse/strikethrough and cursor sequences remain
  (they aren't color). Added in 3.9.0. Backed by `src/belote/ansi.py`.
- `BELOTE_NO_ANIM=1` — short-circuit every 4.8.0 animation helper
  (`pulse_text`, `float_text`, `tick_bar`, the joker callouts, the shop
  purchase/reroll feedback, the trust-bar tick-up, the classic-mode
  trail / winner glow) to its end-state with no perceptible delay.
  Useful on slow terminals, in CI, or under scripted runs. Read once at
  import; tests that mutate it must call
  `belote.ui.anim._refresh_animations_enabled_from_env()` after the
  patch. Independent of `BELOTE_NO_DIFF` — each lever is its own
  toggle. Backed by `src/belote/ui/anim.py`.
- `BELOTE_NO_DIFF=1` — disable the render-diff layer in
  `belote/ui/render.py::display`; every call paints a full frame
  instead of only changed rows. Escape hatch for debugging visual
  artifacts on uncommon terminal emulators.

## Releasing a New Version

### Code-only update (push to GitHub without releasing a new PyPI version)

If you're just iterating on code, fixing typos, updating docs, etc., and don't want to cut a new PyPI release yet:

```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "<what changed>"
git push origin master
```

## Releasing a New Version (Manual)

1. **Bump the version** in BOTH `pyproject.toml` AND `src/belote/__init__.py`
   (they must stay in sync — `belote --version` / `belatro --version` read
   `__version__` while PyPI / pipx read `pyproject.toml`).
2. **Add a CHANGELOG entry** at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. **Clean stale build artifacts:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf dist/ build/ *.egg-info/
   ```
4. **Build, validate, and upload:**
   ```bash
   pipx run build --sdist --wheel
   pipx run twine check dist/*
   pipx run twine upload dist/*
   ```

   *Note: `twine upload` will prompt for your PyPI credentials or use your `~/.pypirc` file.*

5. **Commit and tag in git:**
   ```bash
   git add pyproject.toml CHANGELOG.md
   git commit -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"
   git push origin master --tags
   ```
```
